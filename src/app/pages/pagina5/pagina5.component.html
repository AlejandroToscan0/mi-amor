        When we met for the first time as children, I felt the click... I didn't
        know it until then, but I knew that something in me belonged to you from
        then on, what I didn't know was that what belonged to you was my heart

        But if you ask me why I like you now... I would say everything, and if
        you ask me what everything is, I would write 200 reasons to love you...
        wait... I already did that...! Before I didn't know who you were, I only
        knew you from what people told me about you, but then I met you and I
        learned to love you, with all that you are, and you know? you are
        amazing, you are the best person I've ever met..
